 * Cinko MVC is a light weight PHP MVC Framework with React via 
 * CDN setup on the front end. Created with simplicity in mind, 
 * it's a quick way to get started with MVC and/or React
 * 
 * This is where users enter the application
 *
 * This is the only php file exposed in the public folder.
 * The script Loader.php is included from the parent directory
